HaskFuck
==========================
Experimental (i.e. not working properly) brainfuck interpreter in Haskell
The test program below works but others may not
The , (comma) command has not been implemented yet

I mainly wrote this to try to wrap my head around monad transformers and improve
my general Haskell skills. Please feel free to steal from/modify but bear in
mind I am no Haskell expert (yet) so it may not be a good example to learn from!
